Hi! 👋

I'm Pratik and I've been a software engineer for the last 4 years. I specialise in backend development.

I occasionally write on my [blog](https://www.thecodingpalace.com/).

I also sometimes build side projects (or at least try to).

## Projects

[Send a Secret](https://send-a-secret.web.app/) (in development) — A secure way to share sensitive information via one-time links
